In data directory, final_data_age, final_data_gender and final_data_gpa are used for clustering, and the Xtest, Xtrain, Ytest and Ytrain are used for prediction.

EM algorithm for GMM and VI algorithm for GMM are used for clustering data, and EM algorithm for probit regression is used for prediction. 

There are four matlab files. EM_Clustering_age_gpa is the 3-dimensional EM clustering for height-weight-gpa/age. EM_Clustering_gender is a 2-dimensional clustering of heigt-weigt, for male and female seperately. VI_Clustering is the clustering using variational inference algorithm. EM_prediction is the prediction using EM algorithm.
